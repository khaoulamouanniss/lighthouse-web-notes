### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (!hungry){
    console.log("Get back to work !");
  }
  else{
    if (availableTime < 20){
      console.log("Pick something up and eat it in the lab !");
    }

    else if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30){
      console.log("Try a place nearby !");
    }

    else if(availableTime > 30){
      console.log("Don't forget you're in bootcamp, you should reconsider your lunch time !");
    }
  }
};
```
